# HTMLForms
+ Create a blank HTML document.
+ Plan out how the elements on the page need to be grouped together.
+ Lay out the empty semantic HTML elements for the major sections (form, sidebar, footer…) and make them the proper size and + alignment. It may be helpful to change their background colors while you’re positioning them on the page. Don’t forget to use 
+ your browser’s developer tools (right click on the page, click “inspect element”)!
+ Fill in those elements with the content you want to include.
+ Now style them to look like the real webpage.
+ Push your solution up to Github and you’re good to go!
